## A Nice Fresh GUI


</div>

### Description

I needed to write a program that actually did simple things, but It had to look good, not your normal run of the mill text box and label type thing. I Have created what could be closely be related to a Display engine, you tell it the Details, it does the rest. This is not a full menu list, but I would like to know, is this any good, or is there an easier way and I'm wasting my time???? your feed back is much apreciated
